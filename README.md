Deep Learning Repository
This repository contains implementations of artificial neural networks (ANN) using Keras. It serves as a resource for learning and understanding various neural network architectures and techniques. Additionally, topics related to convolutional neural networks (CNN),RNN will be added after learning.

Contents
ANN Implementations: This directory contains Python files implementing different types of artificial neural networks using Keras.
Usage
Feel free to explore the implementations provided in this repository. Each Python file contains detailed comments to explain the functionality and structure of the neural network model.

Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented a new neural network architecture or have improvements to existing implementations, please feel free to submit a pull request.
